MODULE wp_def
  ! This module contains basic constants and basic input/output subroutines
  ! which depend on the choice of precision, compiler, and MPI implementation

  ! include 'mpif.h'
  USE mpi

  ! Without this, an undeclared name in the write routines below would be
  ! implicitly typed - DEFAULT REAL, i.e. single precision - in the one module
  ! whose entire job is to define the working precision.
  IMPLICIT NONE

  ! Define kind parameter for real type
  INTEGER, PARAMETER :: wp = 8

  ! dprec is the name matelem.f90 and data_gamma.f90  use for the
  ! same kind; kept as an alias of wp.
  INTEGER, PARAMETER :: dprec = wp

  ! This is data type identifier for MPI corresponding to real type of kind wp
  INTEGER, PARAMETER :: MPI_WP = MPI_DOUBLE_PRECISION

  ! This is the number of particles in the system that should be set by the user.
  ! For reasons related to performance, it is made a fixed (compile time) parameter.
  ! ReadIOFile requires the data file to specify EXACTLY this many particles
  ! (PARTICLES record), so it is an exact count, not an upper bound. BH (bh/ECG5): 8;

CONTAINS

  ! Subroutines writereal/writerealadv (one value) and writerealarr/
  ! writerealarradv (arrays) write REAL(wp) values. All real output of the
  ! program goes through them, so the edit descriptor here is the only
  ! place where the output width is fixed. ES24.16 gives 17 significant
  ! digits, an exact decimal round trip for IEEE binary64. The exponent
  ! width is chosen per value: without an explicit width Fortran drops the
  ! 'E' of a three-digit exponent (9.1187360209475736-160), which external
  ! tools misread, so |r| >= 1e99 or |r| < 1e-98 uses ES24.16E3. Both forms
  ! are 24 columns wide.

  FUNCTION IsWideExponent(r)
    ! .TRUE. when r needs a three-digit exponent, so that writereal below
    ! can keep the 'E' instead of letting Fortran drop it. The bounds carry
    ! a decade of margin: a value just under 1e100 can be ROUNDED UP to
    ! 1.0000000000000000E+100 by the formatting itself, and would then lose
    ! its 'E' on the two-digit branch.
